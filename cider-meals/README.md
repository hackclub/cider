How did you build this: I started with React Native and set everything up in VSCode by following guides. I ended up sticking with the environment since it could be tracked by Hackatime and I was most familiar with it while working on a Windows pc. I then followed tutorials on YouTube to get familiar with the basics and using the terminal, and after gaining confidence, I began building my own original version of the app using React Native, sticking with VSCode throughout the process

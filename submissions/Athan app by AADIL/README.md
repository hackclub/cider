A simple, beautiful, and **ad-free** Islamic prayer time app built using **React Native**.

No more ads ruining your Suhoor ✋

## 🚀 About the Project

During Ramadan, I was frustrated by prayer apps full of ads when every second before Fajr counted.  
So I decided to build my own app — clean, accurate, and distraction-free.

### 🔧 Built With:
- **React Native** – so it works on both Android and (soon) iOS
- ❤️ Time, effort, and lots of Suhoor ADS

### 🌍 Currently Supports:
- Cities across **Qatar** (with verified prayer times)
- Global support coming soon, starting with the Gulf

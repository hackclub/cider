# Name: Roosevelt Connect

## Description
Roosevelt Connect is a campus management platform built to address the needs of students and administrators on my home campus.  

Specifically, the app offers:  
- Students the ability to gain information about tutors, rate them, and message them all from within the app  
- An auto-updating agenda with live activities and dynamic island integration  
- The ability to track students while on campus through check-in/check-out managed through Firebase  

Additional features such as club search, event updates, and counselor contact have also been developed but will be rolled out over time with new updates.

**How did you build this**
My team and I used Dart code with the Flutter SDK to create a majority of the app. Certain features such as live activities/dynamic island integration required swift-specific code. All database and authentication integration was done through Firebase, with the use of various Flutter plugins throughout the app.

**Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?:** No, development of all features (including unpublished) took roughly around 100 hours.

**Testflight link:** [https://testflight.apple.com/join/kwAptpKy](https://testflight.apple.com/join/kwAptpKy)  

**How many users on testflight?:**  
5 testers with an active download. Our school’s advisor and administrators asked that we limit the number of people with access to the app to 5 individuals until it is published.  

Their stated reason for this is because an earlier app the school commissioned for student/admin use had failed to reach significant use after the app reached too many students before it was ready…  

Most of our piloting used in-person testing and a google form to provide feedback (can provide form if wanted).

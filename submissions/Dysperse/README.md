**How did you build this**: I built Dysperse using React Native and Expo without any external UI frameworks, handling animations with React Native Reanimated. The backend API is built with TypeScript and Next.js, using Prisma ORM for the database and hosted on Vercel along with the client dashboard. For the native app, I use React Navigation, React Native Gesture Handler, and compile it through EAS Build.

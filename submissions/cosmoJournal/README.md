**GitHub URL**: https://github.com/ssamx3/cosmo

**How did you build this**: I built it using the apple documentation :D (probably some of my favourite docs to work with to be honest - they are wonderfully clear and easy to read). i 
just put bits and bobs together and mashed it all up until i had a functioning app that i liked and hey presto! I really enjoyed working on the ux and design of the app :D

**Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?**: No

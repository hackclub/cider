Name: TabLift

Description: A lightweight, open-source macOS utility that automatically restores minimized app windows when switching with âŒ˜+Tab. It also implements Dock pop ups that show the windows of an app (+traffic light buttons for minimize/close/maximize/fullscreen functionality). It offers custom window management features (e.g. Restore all minimized windows on app switch, Automatically open a window for an app with no windows, Minimize previous window on app switch)

How did you build this: I used Swift UI to build the app. Followed a bunch of guides and tutorials online, started designing a game-plan with Github Copilot and then I started coding. In the first week it was hard to learn to use all of the macOS WindowManagement API's, but i got through and started implementing more and more features, that solved all my long forgotten problems with macOS. I posted on Reddit, talking about my APP and I got a few hundred users and a lot of great feedback that kept me going. I also submitted this app to SummerOfCode and shipped it, but I haven't yet received the ship certificatoin.

Did you use Hakatime to log your progress?: Yes

Testflight link: I didn't put it on the AppStore, but I want to get it notarized. That's why I am applying for the grant, to get an Apple Developer Account and notarize my app.

How many users on testflight?: I've got 1k+ Downloads logged and 700 active Users. I also managed to reach 67 stars on GitHub.

Video Demo URL: [https://bucket.tablift.dev/with.mp4](https://bucket.tablift.dev/with.mp4). It's an older video, implemented a lot of features since then. I want to finish with the new features I want to implement and then release my product on ProductHunt. I will make a youtube video for the app, showcasing my work.

Name: Recollekt

Description and background: 
Not long ago, I lost my big brother due to a car accident, leading to a lot of work and mental stress. 
One thing I found incredibly stressful and tiring was trying to collect pictures and memories from several of his friends and 
family members to compile the funeral video. With this in mind, I created Recollekt- an app where you can create photo albums 
and share them with friends and family. Recollekt is user friendly and allows anyone you share the album with to add images 
so that you don't have to go dming every person. You are also able to compile and edit a video of an album to watch with friends
and family and take a trip down memory lane.

How Did You Build This: I used React-Native paired with express js for the backend. Expo also.

How many hours did you spend on this: around 75

Did you use #hackatime to log your progress?: Yes, but not fully.

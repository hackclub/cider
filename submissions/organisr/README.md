**Name**: Organisr

**Description**: Organisr is an app for storage notes. For a long time, I've always misplaced my things and they were never seen again.. ever. So I decided to make an app to note em' down! Items can be recorded by assigning them to 'boxes', also with data such as description & remarks, or even fancier, dates if you want to record stuff like expiry dates!

**How did you build this**: I learned to use Expo and started with the starter project, read the expo docs and learnt as I go!! Sometimes when I meet errors that I have no idea whats going on, I'd ask chatgpt or find a solution on google/stack overflow.

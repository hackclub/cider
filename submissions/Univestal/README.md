Name: Univestal

Description: What is this app? How does it help you? What problem does it solve for you and your friends?
The app allows teens (and others who might not have the financial resources) to understand the power of investing and trading through cryptocurrency. 
A lot of people my age (myself initially as well) don't have many resources to teach them financial literacy or investing strategies. My app serves as an effective, engaging,
sort of gamified way to bridge the financial literacy gap and make investing universal--for everyone.

How did you build this: I used SwiftUI for all the interface and Swift frameworks like CoreData for the data management and other behind the scenes things. 
I made some API requests too to pull live cryptocurrency market data, as well as searchable news articles relating to finance and business.

How many hours did you spend on this: 2-3 months lol CoreData was hard to wrap my head around.

Did you use #hack-hour to log your progress?: No, since I only found out about Cider today, after I had finished building the app.

Testflight link: I don't have one yet since I need a developer account.

How many users on testflight?: None since I need apple developer account, but I have talked to both family and friends so far I have 15+ people willing to try it out if I can deploy it.

Ship URL: I think it's pending but I was told my demo already got approved. I will update this section later with the link

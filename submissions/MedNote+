Name: MedNote+

Description: What is this app? How does it help you? What problem does it solve for you and your friends?

It takes all of your symptoms and crafts an easy, proffesional email thyat you can send to your boss, coworkers or teachers at school. I used to dread being sick since I would have to wake up and tell all my teachers that I would not come to school that day, but now that is fixed with this application.

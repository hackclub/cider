**Name**: Local Sites Viewer

**Description**:
It is a simple tool for web developers to quickly test their local websites on
other devices, like phones or tablets, connected to the same network.

Instead of typing your IP and port every time, this app does it for you. It detects your local IP,
scans active ports, and shows you a list of working local sites.

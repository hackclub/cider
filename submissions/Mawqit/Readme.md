### Name: Mawqit

**Description:**
**Mawqit** is a super lightweight, fast iOS widget app that brings both **Hijri (Islamic)** and **Gregorian** calendars to your **Home Screen and Lock Screen**. Since Apple doesn’t natively allow switching between these calendars, I built Mawqit to give my father access to both calenders on his lockscreen.

It also shows **upcoming important Islamic dates** (like Ramadan, Eid, etc.) right on the **app** homescreen, so you’re always aware of what’s coming. 

Simple, elegant, and functional.

**How did you build this?**
I used **SwiftUI** and kept the whole experience focused on speed and ease of use. The idea came from Apple not supporting Hijri and Gregorian calendars together, so I decided to solve it myself with a minimal, widget-first approach.
